# MCDF_Verification  
MCDF verification with UVM  

•	Tested the Multi-channel data formatter (MCDF) with APB protocol in Universal Verification Methodology (UVM), covering read-write, illegal access, channel disable, and arbiter priority.  
•	Created TLM port to communicate between each block, sequence and assertion property to send proper data to verify the function, UVM register abstraction layer (RAL) to verify the register.  
•	Decided different cover groups and bins to verify the design and attained code coverage of 95% and functional coverage of 100% in QuestaSim.
